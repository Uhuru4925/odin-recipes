           <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>

           <li>4 cups vegetable or chicken broth</li>

           <li>1/2 cup heavy cream or coconut milk (optional)</li>

            <h4>Steps</h4>
              <ol>
                <i><li>Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Place the cubed butternut squash on a baking sheet, drizzle with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, 
                    and season with salt and pepper. Roast for 25-30 minutes, or until the squash is tender and lightly browned.</li>
                <li>In a large pot, heat the remaining tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. 
                    Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute.</li>
                <li>Add the roasted butternut squash to the pot along with the vegetable or chicken broth. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer for about 10-15 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.</li>
                <li>Using an immersion blender, blend the soup until smooth. Alternatively, you can transfer the soup in batches to a blender and blend until smooth. 
                    Be careful when blending hot liquids.</li>
                <li>If using, stir in the heavy cream or coconut milk for added creaminess. Add ground cinnamon and nutmeg, and season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
                <li>Serve hot, garnished with your choice of toppings such as croutons, roasted pumpkin seeds, fresh herbs, or a drizzle of cream.</li></i>
