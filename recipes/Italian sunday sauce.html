            <li>1 cup beef broth or red wine</li>
    
            <li>2 teaspoons dried basil</li>
    
            <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
    
            <li>1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)</li>
    
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    
            <li>Fresh basil or parsley for garnish (optional)</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Steps</h4>
                <ol>
                <i><li>Heat olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. 
                    Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute.</li>
                <li>Add the Italian sausage and ground beef or pork to the pot. Cook until browned, breaking up the meat with a spoon as it cooks. Drain any excess fat if necessary.</li>
                <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and beef broth or red wine. Mix well to combine.</li>
                <li>Add the dried basil, dried oregano, red pepper flakes (if using), salt, and pepper. Stir to combine all the ingredients.</li>
                <li>Bring the sauce to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low. Cover the pot and let the sauce simmer for at least 1 to 2 hours, stirring occasionally. 
                    The longer the sauce simmers, the more the flavors will develop.</li>
                <li>Serve the Italian Sunday sauce over cooked pasta, garnished with fresh basil or parsley and grated Parmesan cheese if desired.</li></i>
